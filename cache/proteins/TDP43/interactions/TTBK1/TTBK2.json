Multiple studies confirm that Tau Tubulin Kinases 1 and 2 (TTBK1/TTBK2) are key kinases that directly phosphorylate TDP-43 at the pathological Ser409/410 sites. This action promotes TDP-43's mislocalization to the cytoplasm, its aggregation into inclusions, and subsequent neurotoxicity. The provided information is accurate and has been validated and supplemented with extensive evidence.",
