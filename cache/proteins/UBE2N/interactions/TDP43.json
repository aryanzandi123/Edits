A direct comparison of E2 enzymes showed that UBE2N promotes TDP-43 ubiquitination to a much lesser extent than members of the UBE2E family (e.g., UBE2E3). However, pathological TDP-43 aggregates are known to contain K63-linked ubiquitin chains, a linkage type that UBE2N can generate. The function has been corrected to reflect UBE2N's minor role and the broader context of TDP-43 ubiquitination.",
